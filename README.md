# Polynomial Time Algorithms for Exact Shapley Values in Multivariate Clinical Diagnostics Tests

This repository is the official implementation of [Polynomial Time Algorithms for Exact Shapley Values in Multivariate Clinical Diagnostics Tests](https://github.com/Biodesix/dxCortex-shapley) (link will be updated when paper is posted). 

## Requirements

After cloning the repository, make sure all directories and subdirectories contained are in the Matlab path.

## Training, Evaluation, and Results

dxCortex_example.m demonstrates how to set up, train, evaluate, and calculate Shapley values for a basic dxCortex model.  The results produced by the script are similar to those in figure 2 of the paper.
